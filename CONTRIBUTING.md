## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to follow. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bukajs.git
cd bukajs
```

3. Add the original repository as a remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/tumbati/bukajs.git
```

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

4. Run tests with coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

5. Check code quality:

```bash
npm run quality
```

## Code Style and Standards

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style across the project.

### Code Style Rules

- **Indentation**: Use tabs (4 spaces equivalent)
- **Quotes**: Use double quotes for strings
- **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons
- **Line endings**: Use LF (Unix-style)
- **Trailing commas**: Never use trailing commas

### Before Committing

Always run the following commands before committing:

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Check linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

# Check TypeScript types
npm run typecheck
```

Or run all quality checks at once:

```bash
npm run quality
```

```

## Testing

We use Vitest for testing with comprehensive coverage requirements.

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory matching the source structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Aim for high code coverage (minimum 80%)

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Renderer Tests**: Test document format support

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run dev:test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

- Screenshots (if visual issue)

### Template

```markdown
**BukaJS Version:** 1.0.0
**Browser:** Chrome 118
**OS:** Windows 11

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Load PDF document
2. Search for text
3. Click on search result

**Expected:** Should navigate to the page with highlighted text
**Actual:** Nothing happens

**Console Errors:**
```
Error: Cannot read property 'goto' of undefined
```

**Additional Context:**
The issue occurs with PDFs containing special characters.
```

## Feature Requests

Feature requests should include:

- Clear description of the problem to solve
- Proposed solution
- Alternative solutions considered
- Examples or mockups
- Potential impact on existing functionality

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **BukaViewer**: Main viewer class that orchestrates everything
2. **BaseRenderer**: Abstract base class for document renderers
3. **RendererFactory**: Factory for creating appropriate renderers
4. **DocumentDetector**: Utility for detecting document types

### Renderer Architecture

Each document format has its own renderer that extends `BaseRenderer`:

- **PDFRenderer**: Handles PDF documents using PDF.js
- **ImageRenderer**: Handles images (PNG, JPEG, SVG)
- **DocxRenderer**: Handles Word documents using Mammoth.js
- **XlsxRenderer**: Handles spreadsheets using SheetJS
- **PresentationRenderer**: Handles PowerPoint presentations

### Adding New Renderers

1. Create a new renderer class extending `BaseRenderer`
2. Implement required methods: `load()`, `render()`, `search()`
3. Register the renderer with `RendererFactory`
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation

### Event System

BukaJS uses an event-driven architecture:

- Document loading events
- Page navigation events
- Zoom change events
- Search result events
- Annotation events

### Styling System

- Modular CSS with BEM methodology
- Theme support (default, dark, Tailwind CSS)
- Responsive design principles
- CSS custom properties for theming

## Performance Guidelines

- Lazy load resources when possible
- Use virtual scrolling for large documents
- Optimize canvas rendering
- Implement proper cleanup in `destroy()` methods
- Consider memory usage, especially for large files

## Security Considerations

- Validate all input files
- Sanitize HTML content from documents
- Avoid exposing sensitive information
- Use Content Security Policy when possible
- Handle malicious documents gracefully

## Documentation

When contributing, please update documentation:

- JSDoc comments for new APIs
- README for new features
- Examples for new functionality
- TypeScript definitions

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing:

1. Check existing issues and discussions
2. Create a new issue with the "question" label
3. Reach out to maintainers
